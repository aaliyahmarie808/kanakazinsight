		Hula is one of the most important aspects of the Hawaiian culture. Hula is a form of dance that tells stories of the people 
		of Hawaii. Each hula is unique in that it tells a different story of the land and the Hawaiian people. 
		<br>
		One of the biggest festivals that celebrates hula and the Hawaiian culture is the Merrie Monarch Festival, held in Hilo, 
		Hawaii every spring. This festival is a week long and tons of halau hula, or dance schools come to participate. To read 
		more and watch some videos of the Merrie Monarch Festival, click

		Music is another key aspect of Hawaiian culture. Hawaiians tell stories through their oli (chants) and mele (songs). 
		Hula and their mele go hand in hand. Originally, mele were the main performance and hula was much simpler and used to 
		amplify was the singer/chanter was saying. Now, hula is much more complex and choreographed and mele seems to compliment 
		the story being told through the hula.
		<br>
		<br>
		Mele were usually sung in the native language but since the missionaries came to Hawaii in 1820, mele slowly began to 
		incorporate English as well. Today, there are mele sung in both Hawaiian and English. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The video above is of some of Hawaii’s greatest artists singing, Ku Ha’aheo which translates to, “stand strong”. This mele composed 
		by Kumu Hina (kumu = teacher) in 2007, became the anthem of the Mauna Kea movement in 2019. 
		<a href="https://www.oha.org/ku-haahe">Here</a> is a link to the lyrics of this beautiful mele and its translation.

			Hawaii is actually made up of 8 main islands. The image above portrays the island chain, each labelled with their names. As 
			portrayed in the image, the capital of the Hawaiian islands, Honolulu is located on the east side of O’ahu. 
			The capital actually used to be Kailua-Kona, located on the west coast of Hawaii island, during King Kamehameha I reign in 1795. But it was later 
			changed to Honolulu during King Kamehameha III reign in 1825.
			<br>
			<br>
			The Hawaiian islands are the only islands in all of Polynesia that are located above the equator. Located in the tropics, the islands 
			length of day and temperature stay pretty consistent year round. However, with that being said the Hawaiian islands also home 10 of the 14 
			climate zones. From the hot and humid temperatures in Waianae to the cold and snowy weather on Mauna Kea, Hawaii has a wide variety of climates. 
			Nonetheless, this chain of islands location creates the perfect weather conditions for everyone!

			The language spoken in Hawaii is both Hawaiian and English. Hawaiian is a dying language, which is why it’s so important that we 
			continue to keep it alive by learning it from our kupuna (elders) and teaching it to our keiki (children).
		<br>
		<br>
		The Hawaiian language has five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and eight consonants (h, k, l, m, n, p, w, okina).
		<br>
		<br>
		After the illegal overthrow in 1893 and the annexation that followed the year after, English became the official language in Hawaii. 
		However, more recently in 1978 Hawaiian was re-established as the official language of Hawaii. In 1990, the US government recognized 
		Hawaiian’s right to preserve and use their native language. Today, Hawaiian is the most studied indigenous language and is the only 
		language officially used by a state government.
